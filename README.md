What this project is about
---------------------------

This project allows the user to create his/her own warship using draggable parts, ranging from hulls to turrets and superstructure parts.

How to install and use
-----------------------

Navigate to a directory of your choice and clone the project from Github onto your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/leevhoang/build_your_own_ship.git
```

To start it, simply open the ship.html file in a browser of your choice.

Building your ship
-----------------------

- There are two hull parts (the big gray and red ones) in the center of the page. Drag the other parts and put them in any way you want on the top of one of the hull pieces.
- Turrets are the parts on the top left of the page.
- Just below the hull are the parts for the superstructure (or the center part) of the ship.
- On the bottom left of the page are a few smokestack parts.

Changing the Background
-----------------------

- To the far-right area of the navbar is a blue button called "Change Background." Clicking this button will alternate the background between plain white and a simple sky/ocean background.

Clearing your current work
---------------------------

- To clear your current work and start from scratch, simply hit the F5 key on your keyboard or click the "Refresh" button on your browser.

Tips and tricks
-----------------------

- It helps to consult references (such as ship blueprints) online if you plan to build a realistic-looking warship.

Known issues
-----------------------

- On Firefox, blue squares appear around the part when dragging any part other than the smokestacks.

What this project is about
---------------------------

This project allows the user to create his/her own warship using draggable parts, ranging from hulls to turrets and superstructure parts.

How to use
-----------------------

Clone the project from Github onto your computer.
To start it, simply run the ship.html file.

Building your ship
-----------------------

- There are two hull parts (the big gray and red ones) in the center of the page. Drag the other parts and put them in any way you want on the top of one of the hull pieces.
- Turrets are the parts on the top left of the page.
- Just below the hull are the parts for the superstructure (or the center part) of the ship.
- On the bottom left of the page are a few smokestack parts.

Changing the Background
-----------------------

- To the far-right area of the navbar is a blue button called "Change Background." Clicking this button will alternate the background between plain white and a simple sky/ocean background.

Resetting the part position
---------------------------

- To clear your current work and start from scratch, simply hit the F5 key on your keyboard or click the "Refresh" button on your browser.

Tips and tricks
-----------------------

- It helps to consult references (such as ship blueprints) online if you plan to build a realistic-looking warship.

Known issues
-----------------------

- On Firefox, you may see blue squares when dragging a part.

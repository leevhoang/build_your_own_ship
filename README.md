What this project is about
---------------------------

This project allows the user to create his/her own warship using draggable parts, ranging from hulls to turrets and superstructure parts.

How to use
-----------------------

To start it, simply run the ship.html file.

Building your ship
-----------------------

- There is a hull part (the big gray and red one) in the center of the page. Drag the other parts and put them in any way you want on the top of the hull.

- Turrets are the parts on the top left of the page.
- Just below the hull are the parts for the superstructure (or the center part) of the ship.
- On the bottom left of the page are a mast and a few smokestack parts.

Tips and tricks

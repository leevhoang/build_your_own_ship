What this project is about
---------------------------

This project allows the user to create his/her own warship using draggable parts, ranging from hulls to turrets and superstructure parts.

How to use
-----------------------

To start it, simply run the ship.html file.

Building your ship
-----------------------

- There are two hull parts (the big gray and red ones) in the center of the page. Drag the other parts and put them in any way you want on the top of one of the hull pieces.

- Turrets are the parts on the top left of the page.
- Just below the hull are the parts for the superstructure (or the center part) of the ship.
- On the bottom left of the page are a few smokestack parts.

Tips and tricks
-----------------------

- It helps to consult references (such as ship blueprints) online if you plan to build a realistic-looking warship.
